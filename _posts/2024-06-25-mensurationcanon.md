Message ChatGPT with the following one at a time:

* Can you create a melody that is 8 seconds long and is centered around G4?

* Can you show that in code for Sonic Pi?

* Can you play that with a sawtooth wave?

* Can you sustain each note over its entire duration without an attack and a release?

* Can you transpose the melody down by 5 octaves?

* Can you stretch the transposed melody to 30 seconds with no repeats?

* Can we name that transposed melody as MELODY00 without generating Sonic Pi code?

* Can you layer another melody that is 1 octave higher than the melody in the lowest octave and repeats 3 times over the duration of the melody in the lowest octave?

* Can you repeat the last request but for 3 octaves higher and repeating 4 times?
