* Can you create a melody that is 8 seconds long and is centered around G4?

* Can you set the synthesizer to a sawtooth wave?

* Can you sustain each note over its entire duration without an attack and a release?

* Can you transpose the melody down by 5 octaves?

* Can you stretch the transposed melody to 30 seconds with no repeats?

* Can you simultaneously play a copy of that melody that is transpose it up by 1 octave?
