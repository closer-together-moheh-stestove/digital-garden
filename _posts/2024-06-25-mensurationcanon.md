Message ChatGPT with the following one at a time:

* Can you create a melody that is 8 seconds long and is centered around G4?

* Can you play that melody in code for Sonic Pi?

* Can you sustain each note over its entire duration with an attack time of 0 and a release time of 0?

* Can you set the synth to a sawtooth wave?

* Can you transpose the melody down by 5 octaves?

* Can you stretch the transposed melody to 30 seconds with no repeats?

* Can you copy the melody in the lowest octave, transpose it up by 1 octave, and play it 2 times over the existing melody so that they both start and end at the same time?

* Can you copy the melody in the lowest octave again, transpose it up by 2 octaves, and play it 3 times simultaneously over the same 30 second duration? There should now be 3 melodies playing simultaneously.

* Can you repeat the previous request, but the transposition should be 3 octaves, it should play 4 times simultaneously over the same 30 second duration, and there should now be 4 melodies playing simultaneously.

* Can you repeat the previous request another 6 times, each time increasing the transposition up by 1 octave and increasing the number of times played by 1?
